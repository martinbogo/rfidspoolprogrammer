KEYWORD STRATEGY NOTES:

High-value keywords:
- rfid (core functionality)
- nfc (core technology)
- 3d printing / 3d printer (target audience)
- filament / filament spool (main use case)
- anycubic (specific brand compatibility)
- maker (community identification)
- ntag215 / ntag216 (technical specificity)

Avoid:
- Brand names other than Anycubic
- Generic terms like "app" or "tool"
- Duplicate words (counts against character limit)
- Spaces in compound terms where possible

Tips:
- Use comma separation with no spaces
- Singular vs plural: choose based on search volume
- Keywords are case-insensitive
- Order doesn't matter for ranking
- App Store also indexes your app name and description

==========

RECOMMENDED: Option 1
Best balance of technical terms, brand recognition, and broad appeal to the maker community.
