# App Icon Installation Guide

## After generating your icon with GPT-5:

### Method 1: Single 1024x1024 Icon (iOS 14+)

1. Save the generated image as: `AppIcon-1024.png`
2. In Xcode, open: `ACE_RFID_iOS/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/`
3. Open `Contents.json` in that folder
4. Replace the contents with this simplified version:

```json
{
  "images" : [
    {
      "filename" : "AppIcon-1024.png",
      "idiom" : "universal",
      "platform" : "ios",
      "size" : "1024x1024"
    }
  ],
  "info" : {
    "author" : "xcode",
    "version" : 1
  }
}
```

5. Drag `AppIcon-1024.png` into the `AppIcon.appiconset` folder
6. Build and run - iOS will auto-generate all sizes!

### Method 2: Complete Icon Set (All Sizes)

1. Go to https://www.appicon.co/
2. Upload your 1024x1024 PNG
3. Download the generated .zip
4. Extract the .zip
5. In Xcode, right-click `Assets.xcassets` → Show in Finder
6. Delete the existing `AppIcon.appiconset` folder
7. Drag the new `AppIcon.appiconset` folder from the .zip into `Assets.xcassets`
8. Back in Xcode, you should see all icon sizes populated

### Method 3: Manual (Drag & Drop in Xcode)

1. In Xcode, select `Assets.xcassets` in the Project Navigator
2. Click on `AppIcon` in the left sidebar
3. You'll see empty slots for different icon sizes
4. Drag your 1024x1024 image into the "App Store iOS 1024pt" slot
5. For other sizes, you can either:
   - Let Xcode auto-fill (iOS 14+)
   - Or generate all sizes using appicon.co and drag each into its slot

## Verify Installation

1. In Xcode, check `Assets.xcassets/AppIcon`
2. You should see your icon in the preview
3. Build and run on simulator or device
4. Your new icon should appear on the home screen!

## Troubleshooting

### Icon not showing?
- Clean build folder: Product → Clean Build Folder (Cmd+Shift+K)
- Delete app from simulator/device
- Rebuild and reinstall

### "Asset catalog compiler error"?
- Make sure PNG is exactly 1024x1024
- Ensure it's RGB (not CMYK)
- No transparency in the background

### Icon looks blurry?
- Make sure the source is 1024x1024 (not upscaled from smaller)
- Use PNG (not JPG)
- Regenerate with better quality settings
