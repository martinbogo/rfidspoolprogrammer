# Privacy Policy for Spool Programmer

**Last Updated:** October 1, 2025

## Overview

Spool Programmer is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains our approach to data collection and use.

## No Data Collection

**Spool Programmer does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information or usage data. Period.**

### What This Means:
- ✅ No account creation or login required
- ✅ No personal information collected
- ✅ No usage analytics or tracking
- ✅ No crash reports sent to developers
- ✅ No advertising or third-party trackers
- ✅ No cookies or persistent identifiers
- ✅ No data transmitted over the internet
- ✅ No cloud storage or syncing

## Your Data Is Yours

All data you create within the app (filament profiles, color selections, temperature settings) remains entirely on your device. This data:

- Is stored locally on your iPhone
- Never leaves your device
- Is never transmitted to us or anyone else
- Is under your complete control
- Can be deleted by uninstalling the app

## NFC Tag Operations

When you write data to an NFC tag, that data is written directly from your iPhone to the physical tag. No intermediate servers or cloud services are involved. The data on the tag is:

- Written locally by your device
- Not copied or transmitted anywhere else
- Readable by anyone with an NFC reader (it's a physical tag)
- Your responsibility to manage

## Third-Party Services

Spool Programmer does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, advertising networks, or data brokers. There are no embedded SDKs that track your behavior.

## App Permissions

The app requests only the permissions necessary for its core functionality:

**NFC Access:** Required to read and write RFID tags. This permission allows the app to communicate with NFC tags when you initiate a read or write operation. No data from these operations is stored or transmitted.

## Children's Privacy

Spool Programmer does not knowingly collect data from anyone, including children under 13. Since we collect no data at all, the app is safe for users of all ages.

## Open Source

Spool Programmer is based on the open-source ACE-RFID project. You can review the source code at:

## Changes to This Policy

If we ever change our approach to privacy (which we don't plan to), we will update this policy and the "Last Updated" date. However, our commitment to zero data collection is fundamental to this app's design.

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect any data about you:

- ❌ There is no data to access
- ❌ There is no data to delete
- ❌ There is no data to correct
- ❌ There is no data to export
- ❌ There is no data to restrict processing of

✅ **You have complete control because all data stays on your device.**

## Summary

Spool Programmer respects your privacy by simply not collecting any information about you. Your data is yours, and it stays on your device. We believe this is how software should work.
