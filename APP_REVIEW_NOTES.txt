APP REVIEW INFORMATION - NOTES FOR REVIEWERS

=== NOTES (Recommended) ===

Thank you for reviewing Spool Programmer!

TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
This app requires physical NTAG213, NTAG215, or NTAG216 NFC tags for full functionality testing. These are inexpensive tags available from most electronics suppliers.

HOW TO TEST:
1. Launch the app on an iPhone with NFC capability (iPhone 7 or later)
2. Select any filament profile from the dropdown (e.g., "Generic PLA")
3. Choose a color using the RGB picker or presets
4. Hold a blank NTAG213/215/216 tag near the top of the iPhone
5. Tap "Write to Tag" - the app will write filament data to the tag
6. Use "Read from Tag" to verify the written data
7. "Status" button shows tag memory layout and lock status
8. "Format" clears the tag for reprogramming

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- The app does NOT collect, store, or transmit any user data
- All NFC operations are local to the device
- Some pre-programmed manufacturer tags may be write-protected (this is expected behavior and the app will display an appropriate error message)
- Blank tags are recommended for testing
- No account or login required

PRIVACY:
No analytics, no tracking, no data collection. The app only interacts with NFC tags.

If you need blank NTAG213/215/216 tags for testing, I'm happy to mail some to Apple's review facility. Please let me know.

Thank you for your time!

=== ALTERNATIVE SHORTER VERSION ===

This app programs NTAG213/215/216 NFC tags for 3D printer filament spools. 

TESTING: Requires physical NFC tags (NTAG213/215/216). Hold a blank tag near iPhone, select a profile, tap "Write to Tag". Use "Read from Tag" to verify.

NOTE: Pre-programmed manufacturer tags may be write-protected (expected). Blank tags recommended.

PRIVACY: No data collection, no tracking, all operations local to device.

Happy to provide test tags if needed. Thank you!
