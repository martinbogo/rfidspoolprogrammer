ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND ATTRIBUTIONS

This iOS application is based on the RFID tag format and protocol documentation
from the ACE-RFID project:

    ACE-RFID
    Copyright (c) DnG-Crafts
    https://github.com/DnG-Crafts/ACE-RFID

The original ACE-RFID project provides:
- RFID tag format specification for Anycubic 3D printer filament spools
- Communication protocol documentation (N033 Material box communication protocol)
- Reference implementations for Android, Windows, and Arduino platforms

This iOS implementation:
- Is an independent port written in Swift/SwiftUI
- Uses the same RFID tag format and data structure
- Provides equivalent functionality for iOS devices with NFC capability
- Contains no direct code from the original project
- All source code is original work by the iOS implementation author

Credits:
- Original ACE-RFID project and tag format: DnG-Crafts
- iOS implementation: Martin, 2025
- Tag format specification: Based on ACE-RFID documentation
- Anycubic protocol: N033 Material box communication protocol
